                <p class="text-muted text-left" id="pcafpapra">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                <p>The lion King's live-action had a new feeling to it, but still had the same, amazing characters I know and love. As the saying goes: Old is gold, I did feel that the new computer-generated Simba and Nala were acting a bit too realistic. That took away some of the magic of the movie for me. But the pictures and scenery were absolutely stunning! Everything felt higly dynmaic, and I feel like the money was worth it.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">The book was great! It was very consise, giving amzing amounts of deatail, and it was very engaging. There were many dramatic parts and enthrilling fight scenes, which maade readers bite their nails in fear, but also made them want to read further. The book described places in the perfect number of words, and didn't have too much bloodshed. It also had many heartwarming parts, which made me smile from ear to ear. Over all, this was one of Tui's best works as far as I can say.</p>
